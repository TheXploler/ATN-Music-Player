This line of code initializes the pygame.mixer module. pygame.mixer is a part of the pygame library that provides support for playing and mixing audio files.
Before you can use any of the functions or classes in pygame.mixer, you must first initialize the mixer module. This is done by calling the init() function, which sets up the necessary resources and prepares the mixer for use.
For example, if you want to play a sound using pygame.mixer, you would need to initialize the mixer module first
